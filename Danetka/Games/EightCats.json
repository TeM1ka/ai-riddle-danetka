    "riddle": "One man went on vacation and asked a friend to look after his cat. A week later, there were 8 adult cats running around the apartment.",
    "solution": "The next day the cat ran away and the friend had to post a lost pet notice. Since he still did not know the cat very well, he had to keep all the similiar-looking cats that people brought to him, and wait for the owner to return , who would have to identify his pet."
